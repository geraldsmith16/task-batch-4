                    "answer": "<u></u><u>The History of Earth Day : Cleaning Up Our Planet (For Final Assignment)</u><br><span>Earth Day is celebrated every year on\u00a0April 22nd. Take some time to find out about how one man, who was determined to change the way we treated our planet didn&#039;t stop until he had made a difference.<br>In 1963, Senator\u00a0Gaylord Nelson\u00a0was not happy with the earth&#039;s condition. He wanted to clean up the planet and solve pollution and environmental problems. As a senator, Gaylord Nelson was someone chosen by US citizens to help make laws, so he had a lot of power. He went to John F. Kennedy, the President at the time, with his concerns. The President agreed that the planet&#039;s environment was a serious issue, so President Kennedy went around the country on a five day tour to promote the idea of cleaning up the planet. People began making small changes, but it was not enough.<br>A few years later,\u00a0Senator Nelson\u00a0decided to put one day aside every year for the cause of saving the planet. On\u00a0April 22, 1970, the first\u00a0Earth Day\u00a0was celebrated. Since then,Earth Day\u00a0has become an international holiday. People all over the world are doing something to make Earth a cleaner, better place. Kidzworld along with founder, Allen Achilles, make an extra effort to protect the environment by recycling all used electronics.<br></span>",

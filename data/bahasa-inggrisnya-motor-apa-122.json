If you at their roots, you will find that\u2019s the ends of these roots are\nlike fine fibers. We call them root hairs.

It is\nthe leaves which prepare the food.</span>\n\n<span>The green material, chlorophyll present in the\nleaves prepare the food like a machine. It converts the carbon dioxide from the\nair and water from the ground into sugar with the help of sunlight. This\nchemical reaction is called photosynthesis. In fact, the chlorophyll takes\nenergy from the sunlight and uses it to synthesize the hydrogen from water and\ncarbon from carbon dioxide for making sugar. This reaction also gives out\noxygen and water which are excreted by the leaves.</span><br>",

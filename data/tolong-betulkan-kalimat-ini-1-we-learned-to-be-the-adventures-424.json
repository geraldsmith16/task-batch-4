Take some time to find out about how one man, who was determined to change the way we treated our planet didn&#039;t stop until he had made a difference.<br>In 1963, Senator\u00a0Gaylord Nelson\u00a0was not happy with the earth&#039;s condition. He wanted to clean up the planet and solve pollution and environmental problems. As a senator, Gaylord Nelson was someone chosen by US citizens to help make laws, so he had a lot of power. He went to John F. Kennedy, the President at the time, with his concerns. The President agreed that the planet&#039;s environment was a serious issue, so President Kennedy went around the country on a five day tour to promote the idea of cleaning up the planet. People began making small changes, but it was not enough.<br>A few years later,\u00a0Senator Nelson\u00a0decided to put one day aside every year for the cause of saving the planet. On\u00a0April 22, 1970, the first\u00a0Earth Day\u00a0was celebrated. Since then,Earth Day\u00a0has become an international holiday. People all over the world are doing something to make Earth a cleaner, better place. Kidzworld along with founder, Allen Achilles, make an extra effort to protect the environment by recycling all used electronics.<br></span>",

It is a cube-shaped and\ncontains of smaller cube pieces with six sides having different colors. The\ncube was so popular during the 1980s, and at its peak between 1980 and 1983.\n200 million cubes were sold world wide. In the solved condition, Rubik\u2019s cube\nhas six faces which all of the colors are same. The Rubik&#039;s cube has red,\nyellow, blue, green, white, and orange color. The edges and corners move when\nthe cube is rotated and the cube becomes scrambled. The challenge of the puzzle\nis to solve each cube to the original position. </span>\n<span>\n<br></span>\n<span>\n<span>There are many solutions to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube. Lars\nPetrus, Jessica Fridich, and Shotaro Makisumi, are people who created the\nsolution to solve it. A common solution used by cubers was developed by Jessica Fridrich,\na professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University. It\nuses a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the\nlast layer. The cross consists of one color is done first and then continue to\nmake second and first layer by F2L (First 2 Layer) algorithms that consist of\n41 algorithms. The next step is to solve the third layer by OLL (Oriented Last\nLayer) and PLL (Permutation Last Layer). Fridrich&#039;s\nsolution requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but the Cube can\nbe solved in only 55 moves on average.</span></span>\n<span>\n<br></span>\n\n\n<span>\n<span>There are two kinds of Rubik\u2019s cube, DIY and Original\nRubik\u2019s cube. DIY (Do It Yourself) Rubik\u2019s cube is the cube that can be\nassembled and modified by ourselves. The core of it made up of bolts; so we can\narrange the bolts to get a comfortable Rubik\u2019s cube. Types of DIY Rubik\u2019s cube\nare, A type, C type, and F type. Every type has different advantages for\ncubers. For the example, F type is a lightweight Rubik\u2019s cube and it almost\ncan\u2019t be pop out. It is suitable for a stylish cuber. C type has a good\nmaterial and it suitable for a rush cuber. The second type is Original Rubik\u2019s\ncube or we can call Ori Rubik. Ori Rubik is the cube that can\u2019t be assembled or\nmodified by ourselves. The core of this made of nails. Ori Rubik is suitable\nfor a beginner cuber that\u2019s training their fingertrick.\u00a0</span></span>\n<br><span>\n<span><br><br><br>artinya<br><br><br></span></span><span><span>Kubus Rubik<br><br></span>Kubus Rubik adalah teka-teki mainan yang dirancang oleh Erno Rubik , seorang arsitek dan profesor di University of Budapest .

Kubus itu begitu populer pada tahun 1980-an , dan pada puncaknya antara tahun 1980 dan 1983 . 200 juta kubus terjual di seluruh dunia . Dalam kondisi dipecahkan , kubus Rubik memiliki enam wajah yang semua warna yang sama . Kubus Rubik memiliki merah, kuning , biru , hijau , putih , dan warna oranye .

Setiap jenis memiliki kelebihan yang berbeda untuk cubers . Misalnya , tipe F adalah kubus Rubik ringan dan hampir tidak dapat pop keluar . Sangat cocok untuk cuber stylish . Tipe C memiliki bahan yang baik dan cocok untuk cuber terburu-buru . Tipe kedua adalah kubus Rubik asli atau kita dapat memanggil Ori Rubik .
